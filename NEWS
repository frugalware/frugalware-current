    * Improved x86_64 emul packages, allowing the use of i686-only packages such

Frugalware (0.7)

  pre2: pending

    * Package updates:
      * Linux kernel 2.6.22
      * GCC-4.2.1, with several bugfixes and usable java browser plug-in for
	systems where the binary is not available, like x86_64.
      * OpenOffice.org 2.2.1
    * New features:
      * New graphical configuration tool: Gnetconfig to tweak your network
        settings.
      * The setup now puts the installer log to the target system, so that it
        is not lost.
      * The default timezone and keyboard layout is now language-dependent.
      * New Italian translation in the installer.
    * New packages:
      * vim spell-check dictionaries for various languages
      * More than 100 new packages: qmpdclient, gpsdrive, emovix, gpodder,
        horde-webmail and much more!
    * Homepage:
      * It is now possible to browse HTML documentation for a package
        on the homepage.
      * According to the SCM we use, replaced darcsweb with gitweb, which
        should be much more faster generally.
    * A list of bugs reported after the release of the installer images can be
      viewed at http://wiki.frugalware.org/KnownBugs-0.7pre2

  pre1: May 24, 2007

    * Renamed our package management library to libpacman as it isn't specific
      to any distribution
    * Added C# bindings (including an example) to Pacman-G2.
    * Translators are now welcome to localize Frugalware. See the brand new
      http://frugalware.org/docs/translations page for more info.
    * OpenOffice.org 2.2  should appear better to users thanks to its support
      for kerning, a technique that improves the appearance of text written in
      proportional fonts; kerning is now enabled by default. OpenOffice's PDF
      (Portable Document Format) export function has also been enhanced with
      the addition of the optional creation of bookmarks feature, and with
      support for user-definable export of form fields.
    * libncursesw: a new ncurses library providing utf8 support.
    * Support for Xorg 6.x finally removed. This should cause some speedup
      since libraries are no longer searched under /usr/X11R6/lib
    * Security support for Terminus available
    * Security support for Siwenna no longer available
