= The Frugalware Bug Reporting HOWTO

== Introduction

The aim of this HOWTO is to explain how to choose a task name and what to
include in a feature request/bugreport to help Frugalware developers speed up
the process of fixing a bug or fulfilling a feature request.

== Where

The URL of our Bug tracking system is:

---------------------------
http://bugs.frugalware.org/
---------------------------

== General

Before opening a task, use the search function, maybe there is a task for your
bug/feature. In that case just add a comment such as "I can reproduce this, too."
or "I would enjoy this feature, too."

There are a few topics which are often requested / reported but we have
a good reason not fixing / implementing them. You can see a list of such
topics in the http://wiki.frugalware.org/index.php/Bugs_FAQ[wiki].

If you'd like to report an outdated package, first check that it isn't listed on
http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/chkworld.html[this site]. If the package
is listed please do *not* report it as we know there is a new version and we 
will update it as soon as possible.

Write bugreports in English, please. This is the only language all
developers speak.

== Bugreport

Please include the following things, unless you know what you are doing:

. Description of Problem - never say "does not work", quote the error message
. Steps to reproduce the problem
. Actual Results
. Expected Results
. How often does this happen?
. Additional Information

The default arch is i686 and the default version is -current. If these are not
true, don't forget to change them!

If you report a -current installer bug, then maybe -current is not enough,
please specify the snapshot date.

If you found a security bug, then use the [SEC] prefix in the task name.

== Feature Requests

Please don't request more than one package in a feature request. Open a task
for every package. (Of course you don't have to open task for dependencies if
they are also missing from our packages.)

If you request a package, please include:

. The name of the application (yes, "more games" is not enough!)
. The URL of the application
. Optionally a short note about why you think this package would be
  interesting for others, too

If you have a FrugalBuild for the package already, then after opening the task,
upload it as an attachment. In this case, please prefix your task name with
`[FB]`, because this way it'll be reviewed sooner.

Alternatively, you can post your FrugalBuild to the `frugalware-devel` mailing
list for review, that can be handy if you want to submit more and more
buildscripts - finally to become a developer if possible. Opening a task for
your FrugalBuild is still fine if you want us to maintain it after the initial
version is accepted.

Please don't link other distribution's buildscripts when you request a package. 
That information is useless for us in most cases and if you don't include such
links, you make our life easier.

=== Don't request

Please don't request custom kernels. We try to use as few patches as possible.
See `man kernel.sh` as a reference on building your own kernel using various
patchsets. Also a
http://wiki.frugalware.org/index.php/How_to_build_a_custom_kernel[tutorial] is
available. Really, building such a kernel usually requires a buildscript of
only 5 lines!

== Pacman-g2 problems

If you get a crash from our package manager then we need a backtrace from gdb.
Here are the instructions to get a backtrace:

- Find the command line that triggers the crash. For example:
  pacman-g2 -Sy

- Get the pacman-g2 git repo and compile it with debug symbols enabled:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone http://frugalware.org/git/pub/other/pacman-g2/pacman-g2
$ cd pacman-g2
$ sh autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-debug
$ make
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Then run pacman-g2 in gdb and get the trace:
+
----------------------------
$ cd src/pacman-g2
$ sudo libtool gdb ./pacman-g2
> run -Sy
----------------------------

- When pacman-g2 crashes, get the trace by typing 'bt'. Here is an example:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0805035e in pacman_sync (targets=0x0) at sync.c:354
354             *p = 1;
(gdb) bt
#0  0x0805035e in pacman_sync (targets=0x0) at sync.c:354
#1  0x08054594 in main (argc=2, argv=0xbfee1844) at pacman.c:609
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Attach the output of 'bt' to your bugreport.

== Fixed in git

Your feature request / bugreport may be closed with a "Fixed in git ..."
message. Git is our source control management software (just like CVS). If
your task is not considered to be critical, then it will be fixed/implemented
only in git, without increasing the package release. This means that it will
be automatically included in the next release.
