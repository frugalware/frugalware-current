= Frequently Asked Developer Questions

== What is the recommended way to version bump a package if I don't have git push access?

.. Update the FrugalBuild.
.. Optional: update the patches/docs/etc.
.. Compile the package.
.. Upload the new .fpm to incoming.
.. repoman rec, git format-patch and git send-email the fixes. (Don't forget to set your git identity!)

== makepkg ends up with <packagename>: /usr/info/dir: exists in filesystem

Instead of

`make DESTDIR=$startdir/pkg install`

you should write

`Fmakeinstall`

in your FrugalBuild.

== I can't pacman-g2 -Su <package>, it says local version is newer, but I know it isn't!

This is a bug in the package's version numbering, so please report this in the
Bug Tracker System. Since pacman-g2 checks the version numbers (installed vs.
repo version), the new package's version must be bigger than the old one to
upgrade flawlessly.

== What does 5.55 SBU mean?

It took 5.55 times longer for the maintainer to compile this package than
binutils. So if you want to know how long it will take to compile a package
with 5.55 SBU, you should first compile binutils (makepkg helps you, as it
writes how many seconds elapsed). Then you should multiply it by 5.55 to know
how many seconds it will take to compile the package.

== Why do maintainers cry about my new package's tarball?

Let's have a look at the filelist of eaccelerator's tarball:

------------------------------------------
$ tar -tf eaccelerator-0.9.3-1.tar.bz2
eaccelerator/
eaccelerator/eaccelerator-0.9.3.zip
eaccelerator/FrugalBuild
eaccelerator/README.Frugalware
eaccelerator/eaccelerator-0.9.3-1-i686.fpm
------------------------------------------

You have to name the tarball as <pkgname>-<pkgver>-<pkgrel>.tar.bz2 (or gz),
which should only contain a <pkgname> directory at the root level, and all the
files needed to create the fpm in it. It is the easiest way for the
maintainers to work with your tarball when adding your package to the repo.

== What should and shouldn't I include in depends(), rodepends() and makedepends()?

You should include only what chkdep -p recommends, and avoid trivial
makedepends, including:

* auto*
* make
* gcc
* kernel-headers
* libtool
* glibc

Don't forget: every depends is a makedepends as well!

The rodepends() array should only contain packages really needed for running
the given application.

== What are the various dependancy-control arrays for?

* 'depends' should contain any packages that this one depends on at compile and
run time as well.
* 'makedepends' is for packages that this one needs to compile.
* 'rodepends' is for run time only dependencies;
eg. a wordlist package (with no executables) needs a program
which can handle it as a dictionary.
* 'provides' is an alternate name for the package. Main use is for
more packages which do the same; eg. hunspell-en and hunspell-de both provide
hunspell-dict, and hunspell depends on hunspell-dict instead of any specific
language. (Sometimes those packages are conflicting, like postfix provides
_and_ conflicts with mta, and exim too - this way there can be only one MTA on
the system, without the need to know other MTAs' name.)

Be careful with dependency-cycles: while pacman-g2 can handle them, makepkg can
not.

== How can I have PHP to work with my newly packaged eaccelerator/anything extension?

Since package A should not tamper with package B's config files,you should write
a README.Frugalware, describing how to enable/use the extension, include it in
source() and Fdoc README.Frugalware.

== How can I cross-compile (package) an architecture-independent (non-binary) program?

You should modify carch and chost in '/etc/makepkg.conf' and build the package
again.

== repoman upd can't create /var/fst/ as it already exists

`Su -` to root and

`cd /var/fst && mv * frugalware-current`

== How can I access the central FW repo (mirrors are too slow for me)?

`git clone http://git.frugalware.org/repos/frugalware-current`

If you are a developer and cloning over SSH makes more sense to you:

`git clone git.frugalware.org:/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current`

This creates a new local repo for you, which is a copy of the central repo. To
update it, run

`git pull --rebase`

in it. That's all to have a read-only copy; if you want to git send-email
patches, then you should read the link:getting-involved.html[Git docs] to set
up your name, email, etc.

== What should I write as patch name and long comment at repoman rec?

Patch name should be the same as the fpm (but without .fpm, of course); and long
comment should only contain what you have done to create that patch (eg. "added
i686 to archs()").

== Where should I place my comments about a package?

You mean README.Frugalware. It should be in source() and then at the end of the
build() you should use:

Fdoc README.Frugalware

It is automatically included if you use empty build() or Fbuild.

== I want to work with the latest development version of pacman&co.! How?

------------------------------------------------------------------
$ git clone http://git.frugalware.org/repos/pacman-tools
$ cd pacman-tools
$ make dist
------------------------------------------------------------------

You will have a brand new .tar.gz. Give it to pacman-tools' FrugalBuild,
correct the checksum, create a new pacman-tools package (makepkg -fucH helps)
and install it. That's all (and if you don't understand this, read it again,
and if it's still not clear, then wait for pacman-tools' normal upgrade
since you don't need this really)...

== Naming locale packages

What is the order of a new package's locales? How should I name them?

Have a look at hunspell There is a hunspell package, which depends on
hunspell-dict. There is no package named hunspell-dict, but it is provided by
the locale packages. The most important ones are -en (==en_US), -hu (==hu_HU),
-de (==de_DE), -fr (==fr_FR), -it (==it_IT), -es (==es_ES) and -sk (==sk_SK).
Here are others: -en_US, -de_CH, -es_MX.

The -xx packages will be installed by the non-CD based (ie. netinst, DVD)
installers.

== Error handling

You are responsible for checking if a command used in build() fails. The best is
to use the F* macros where possible since they handle the errors for you. If you
need custom commands, it's recommended to append `|| return 1` to every line, so
that build() will stop if an error occurs.

== Permissions

If text files (header files, documentation) are executable, feel free to fix
their permission. A bigger problem is the permission of the shared libraries.
They must be executable, please fix their permission if necessary. As always,
it's recommended to create a patch to fix the problem and send it to the
upstream project.

== Stripping

Stripping binaries is unnecessary and pointless. Unless you use
`options=(\'nostrip\')` in the FrugalBuild, it's done by makepkg automatically.

== When should I use $Fsrcdir and $Fdestdir

Most F* macros will prepend/append those variables for you, but if you use
custom commands, then you always have to use them.

== When should I increment a package's release number?

* If your change affects only the FrugalBuild (like an up2date fix) then you
  should not, just push your change.
* If your change affects the fdb or the fpm (change in build(), depends() fix,
  etc) you should do so.

== How do I repair a corrupted package database?

Restore a backup from the `/pub/other/fdb-snapshot` directory, and check its
version (the `.version` file in the tarball).

Then run:

----
$ for i in `git log --pretty=oneline 94a41e0..|sed 's/^[^ ]* \([^ ]*\).*/\1/'\
	|sed 's/-[^-]*-[^-]*-[^-]*$//'`; do ls ../source/*/$i &>/dev/null \
	|| continue; updatesync upd frugalware-current.fdb \
	../source/*/$i/FrugalBuild; done
----
