== GCC Minor Bump

A GCC Minor Bump is defined as a version bump within the same major series.
Example: 4.8.3 to 4.8.4

To perform a GCC minor bump:

- update gcc's pkgver
- reset gcc's pkgrel to 1
- update gcc's sha1sums
- push gcc and wait for build to finish

Things to rebuild after GCC minor bump (IMPORTANT):

- update libtool's pkgrel
- update libtool's version dependency on gcc
- rebuild libtool (must be done IMMEDIATELY after gcc)
- push libtool and wait for build to finish
- update llvm's pkgrel
- update llvm's version dependency on gcc
- rebuild llvm
- push llvm and wait for build to finish

To test a GCC minor bump, follow the same steps you would use to perform a
minor kernel bump, including the kernel-initrd and kernel-module rebuilds.
There are other ways to test that gcc can still compile correctly, but this
seemed like the easiest choice because a compilation issue with the kernel
should be pretty obvious.
