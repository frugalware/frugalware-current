= The init scripts, bootup

== About the kernel

The Linux kernel is in the kernel package. We're trying to use as few patches
as possible to stay close to the vanilla kernel. We also use
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/splashy[splashy] instead of well known bootsplash.
The kernel contains compiled-in support for most IDE controllers, but all
low-level SCSI drivers are compiled as a module. If Frugalware's kernel
doesn't contain built-in support for your controller, you can compile your
own kernel. Don't worry, it's fairly simple.

1. After setup is finished, before hitting ENTER to reboot, switch to `tty2` by
pressing `Alt-F2` and press ENTER to get a shell.

2. Change your root directory to /mnt/target:
+
--------------------
# chroot /mnt/target
--------------------

3. The source of your kernel (with additional patches applied) can be found
at `/usr/src/linux`. So go to the `/usr/src/linux` directory and enter the
configuration menu by typing `make menuconfig`. Inside it, select the driver
you don't want to compile as a module anymore, and exit from the menu with
saving changes.

4. Compile your kernel with the `make` command. This may take several minutes.

5. Copy your new kernel to `/boot` by typing the following command:
+
------------------------------------------------------------
# cp /usr/src/linux/arch/$yourarch$/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz
------------------------------------------------------------
+
On x86, `$yourarch$` has to be replaced by i386.

== Init scripts and services

In Frugalware, init scripts are always called rc.something and
they are located in /etc/rc.d. They are used to setup the environement and
also allow to manage system services.

The services are UNIX daemons that provides various kind of service. The spectrum
of their actions are very large. Synchronizing your system clock, running your webserver,
running the virus scanner, all of these are services and they offer much much more.

The files that allow to manage them can be found in /etc/rc.d, but usually
you will prefer to use our utility `service`. This tool allows you to control
the running state of the services.

In the following examples we will explain how to alter the running state of
a given service. You will have to replace `$service_name$` with the wanted service name.
As you will see the syntax is simple, and you may get more help looking and the
`service` manual doing:

-------------
$ man service
-------------

IMPORTANT: Later in this document you will see how to alter the configuration of these
services so that they follow your needs. You should better learn how to control them,
but don't be afraid, the syntax is really simple, and you will learn it in less then a minute.

=== Controlling a service execution

Services can be started, restarted and stopped, so that you can control what your
system has to offer.

To start a service, simply do:

------------------------------
# service $service_name$ start
------------------------------

To restart a service, simply do:

--------------------------------
# service $service_name$ restart
--------------------------------

To stop a service, simply do:

-----------------------------
# service $service_name$ stop
-----------------------------

As you can see, controlling a service execution is pretty simple.

=== Controlling a service execution on system boot

Controlling the automatic execution of services on system startup is not much more difficult.

To add a service for automatic execution on system startup, simply do:

----------------------------
# service $service_name$ add
----------------------------

To delete a service for automatic execution on system startup, simply do:

----------------------------
# service $service_name$ del
----------------------------

To list the runlevels in which the service will be running, simply do:

-----------------------------
# service $service_name$ list
-----------------------------

== System boot, runlevels

If you don't pass any extra 'init=/path/to/init' parameters to it, the kernel
will start /sbin/init as the final step of the kernel boot sequence.
According to the content of /etc/inittab, init will run:

1. each S* script at /etc/rc.d/rcS.d

2. each S* script at /etc/rc.d/rcn.d, where n is the default runlevel.
This is set to 4 by default. Here is the list of available runlevels:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
0 = halt
1 = single user mode
2 = unused (but configured the same as runlevel 3)
3 = multiuser mode (text mode)
4 = multiuser mode, X11 with KDM/GDM/XDM (default Frugalware runlevel)
5 = unused (but configured the same as runlevel 3)
6 = reboot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If X11 is configured, /etc/rc.d/rc.4 will start one of the desktop managers,
as configured in '/etc/sysconfig/desktop'.

== GRUB gfxmenu

Frugalware comes with a nice graphical grub menu
(thanks to SuSE's gfxmenu developers). If you don't like it, you can disable
it by commenting out the gfxmenu initialization line in /boot/grub/menu.lst.
So for example:

Before: `gfxmenu (hd0,5)/boot/grub/message` +
After: `#gfxmenu (hd0,5)/boot/grub/message`

== Splashy

Frugalware uses splashy to display nice splash screen and a progress bar
instead of text messages during the boot procedure. Splashy is completely
user-space, so there is no need for patching the kernel.
If you dislike it or want to switch it off for whatever reason add
nosplashy for your kernel parameters in '/boot/grub/menu.lst'. For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------
kernel (hd0,2)/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda5 ro quiet vga=791 nosplashy
----------------------------------------------------------------
