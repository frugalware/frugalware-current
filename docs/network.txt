= Networking

== Initializing the network card

In most cases, configuring your network card will be done automatically by
udev. This means that during every system boot your network card will be
detected, and the necessary modules will be loaded. If you want, you can load
your network card's module manually by editing the `/etc/sysconfig/modules`
file and put the module in the blacklist by editing `/etc/sysconfig/blacklist`.
Configuring any interface on your card will be the task of the netconfig
utility. Initializing your card ends here.

== The netconfig utility

Configuring your network settings is done by the netconfig utility.

. First, we have to give a name to your computer. The name must consist of at
least two parts, separated by a dot (.).

. In the next dialog, you should choose how your machine connects to the network.
If you have an internal network card and an assigned IP address, gateway, and
DNS, use static to enter these values. If your IP address is assigned by a
DHCP server (commonly used by cable modem services, not equal to dsl
services), select dhcp. In case you've got a DSL connection (eg. ADSL) chose
the dsl option! Finally, if you do not have a network card,
select the lo choice. The lo is also the correct choice if you are
using a PCMCIA network card.

When you set up the network first question will be the interface you want to set up.
It is usually eth0, but it can differ when you set up wireless interfaces for example.
If you set up a wireless card netconfig will also ask your ESSID and encription key.

.. If you chose static, you must give your IP address, the netmask of your
local network, your gateway address (you may leave it blank) and the IP
address of your primary name server (you can add more nameservers later
by editing the '/etc/resolv.conf' file) and then the configuration is finished.

.. If you chose dhcp, you can optionally give your dhcp hostname, however,
netconfig will not ask more questions about your network, since all
other data will be provided by the DHCP server.

.. In dsl part you must give your username, something like 'someone@provider.net'.
Then you'll have to specify the network interface (usually eth0) through
which the ADSL connecting script will try to communicate with your ADSL
modem. Then enter your password twice.

.. If you chose lo, you don't have to answer any questions.

. Finally, netconfig will write all your network configuration files. If you
want to edit your settings by hand, the interface information is stored in
the '/etc/sysconfig/network' directory. There is only one file there called
default in most cases. It's because you can set up more then one profile.
It's very useful when you got a laptop so you can set up options for all
networks you use.

== Basic firewall configuration

Frugalware comes with a firewall configuration working out of the box.
This allows all outgoing connections, and incoming packets for established
connections. It does not allow normal incoming packages for any ports.
The firewall configuration is at '/etc/sysconfig/firewall'.

NOTE: You will not find this file if you have not installed iptables package
as this is an iptables firewall.

Let's see an example: you would like to allow others to ssh into your
computer. Edit /etc/sysconfig/firewall, remove the hashmark (#) from
the beginning of the line under the # ssh description, and restart
the firewall:

--------------------------
# service firewall restart
--------------------------

The same applies for Apache or any other services.

If you would like to have any advanced firewall settings, configure
your firewall as root with iptables then save your config as root
with:

-----------------------------------------
# iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/firewall
-----------------------------------------

WARNING: It will overwrite your existing configuration! It is strongly
recommended to make a backup of '/etc/sysconfig/firewall' before saving
your settings.
