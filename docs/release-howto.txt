= Frugalware Release HOWTO

== Introduction

The aim of this howto is to show what's the procedure of a stable Frugalware
release. The to-be-created release in this howto is 0.5, the previous release
is 0.4.

== A testing release

A testing release is similar to a full one, but much simpler. Here are
the steps:

- bump the `frugalware` package: update the Makefile in
  `frugalware.git`, upload a new release tarball, and update the package
  in -current
- rebuild the `setup` package, update the version of the `frugalware`
  package dependency to the new version
- wait for the nightly cronjob to publish setup kernel+initrd under
  `/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/boot`
- now you can generate a netinstall iso using mkiso for a single
  architecture you can test and upload the image to
  `/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current-iso`
- do a default install and make sure the machine boots up and you can
  log in using the graphical interface (if not, then fix it)
- run `dg tag <version>` for the new version and push it
- sync changes from -current to -testing:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rsync -avP --delete-after frugalware-current/ frugalware-testing/
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- generate installer images for a single architecture using
  `mkisorelease`
- wait at least 24h so that mirrors will be in sync
- update news.xml and roadmap.xml to mark the release as done

== Preparing

- send a mail to -devel about "please stop version and release bumps"
- check if the artwork has been updated completely. see
  http://frugalware.org/pipermail/frugalware-devel/2007-February/003163.html[this]
  mail from Nadfoka on what items should be checked
- ask someone to update the screenshots
- sync the archs, checkpkgs shouldn't have any red pkg in it's output
- run gensync to rebuild the fdbs
- generate isos and test if everything is ok
  (ie. install from cd1-cd2 on i686, and start kde, or something)
- check if the upgrade from 0.4->0.5 works or not, probably a simple -Syu is
  not enough, then write a howto
- tag the release using git tag

== Creating the stable tree

Copy the full tree on genesis:

----------------------------------------
$ cd /home/ftp/pub/frugalware
$ cp -av frugalware-current frugalware-0.5
----------------------------------------

== Updating the -current tree

Now one has two trees. All what one should do in -current is to
regenerate ChangeLog.txt (copy & paste the command from
`tools/genpkgdbs`).

== Updating the -stable tree

- rename the frugalware-current fdbs to frugalware

- run tools/mkpkglst for each arch

- update VERSION in docs/Makefile, and rebuild the manual

- update `\.git/description`

- run genpkgs to regenerate the ChangeLog.txt to start from
  the 0.4 tag to the 0.5 tag

- update pacman-{g2,-tools} and fwsetup so that -stable will be the
  default on -Syu / repoman upd / in the installer, not -current

- upload the fdbs to the mysql db using fpm2db, just run all2db.sh from the
  /tools dir

- create a new chroot tarball for each arch

== Testing

- generate isos, test _all_ of them (net,cd,dvd for each arch)
- create an usb stick installer tarball for each arch
- create an tftp boot image for each arch
- create a gui installer image for each arch

== Announcement

- put the isos online and wait at least 24h so that the mirrors will be in
  sync at release time
- create torrents for the isos and make sure at least one machine seeds them
- add the new version to the bts
- write an announcement, put it out to somewhere and ask Alex or LGee to
  spellcheck it
- push it to the homepage-ng repo
- mark the release as "done" in `/frugalware/xml/roadmap.xml` (homepage-ng repo)
  and add the proper newsid value
- update the topic of `#frugalware`
- update the freshmeat entry

== For the next release

- find a codename
- update roadmap.xml

Done!
