= Frugalware Release HOWTO

== Introduction

The aim of this howto is to show what's the procedure of a stable Frugalware
release. The to-be-created release in this howto is 0.5, the previous release
is 0.4.

== A testing release

Just because I don't know where to document this, here is the command line what
I use to sync changes from -current to -testing before a release:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rsync -avP --delete-after frugalware-current/ frugalware-testing/
--------------------------------------------------------------------

== Preparing

- send a mail to -devel about "please stop version and release bumps"
- check if the artwork has been updated completely. see
  http://frugalware.org/pipermail/frugalware-devel/2007-February/003163.html[this]
  mail from Nadfoka on what items should be checked
- ask someone to update the screenshots
- sync the archs, checkpkgs shouldn't have any red pkg in it's output
- run gensync to rebuild the fdbs
- generate isos and test if everything is ok
  (ie. install from cd1-cd2 on i686, and start kde, or something)
- tag the release using git tag

== Creating the stable tree

Copy the full tree on genesis:

----------------------------------------
$ cd /home/ftp/pub/frugalware
$ cp -av frugalware-current frugalware-0.5
----------------------------------------

== Updating the -current tree

Now one have two tree. All what one should do in -current is to bump
`--from-tag` version to 0.5 in tools/genpkgs.

== Updating the -stable tree

- rename the frugalware-current fdbs to frugalware
- rebuild the initrd with

-------------
STABLE = true
-------------

  in the Makefile
- s/-current// in tools/mkpkglst
- update VERSION in docs/Makefile
- update `\.git/description`
- update kernel FrugalBuild to hardwire the kernel release (`\_F_kernel_rel`)
- update `/source/include/kernel-module.sh` (s/=/>=/) and rebuild the fdbs
  again
- run the just modified genpkgs to regenerate the ChangeLog.txt to start from
  the 0.4 tag to the 0.5 tag
- update pacman{,-tools} so that -stable will be the default on -Syu / repoman
  upd, not -current
- upload the fdbs to the mysql db using fpm2db, just run all2db.sh from the
  /tools dir
- create a new chroot tarball for each arch

== Testing

- generate isos, test _all_ of them (net,cd,dvd for each arch)
- create an usb stick installer tarball for each arch
- create an tftp boot image for each arch
- check if the upgrade from 0.4->0.5 works or not, probably a simple -Syu is
  not enough, then write a howto

== Announcement

- put the isos online and wait at least 24h so that the mirrors will be in
  sync at release time
- create torrents for the isos and make sure at least one machine seeds them
- add the new version to the bts
- write an announcement, put it out to somewhere and ask Alex or LGee to
  spellcheck it
- push it to the homepage-ng repo
- mark the release as "done" in `/frugalware/xml/roadmap.xml` (homepage-ng repo)
  and add the proper newsid value
- update the topic of `#frugalware`
- update the freshmeat entry

== For the next release

- find a codename
- update roadmap.xml

Done!
