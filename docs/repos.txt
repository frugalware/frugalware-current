= Handling git repositories

== Introduction

This document is for developers who want to publish a git repository on the
Frugalware FTP Server and on the Frugalware Gitweb Interface.

== Location of the repository

Since a repository consists of plain files, we can and should place them on the ftp
server (/home/ftp). To prevent further problems, always use the server name
"git.frugalware.org", currently it's an alias of genesis.frugalware.org.

First decide if it's a personal repository or a team one. For example if you
create a repository to update to a newer python version, then probably you will
do all the work, create it under `/pub/other/people/nick/reponame`. Simply
create a dir, issue `git init` and push at least one commit to there.

Now anyone can `git clone` it, using a 'full mirror', for example
`ftp://ftp12.frugalware.org/mirrors/ftp.frugalware.org/pub/`.

== Registering for the gitweb interface

If the repository is a team one, then create it under /pub/other. In this case
probably you want the gitweb interface, too. To use it:

. Update the file `.git/description` inside the repo with a short (less than 80
chars) description.

. Create the file `.git/owner` inside the repo containing your name, _without_
your email address.

. Push a _relative_ symlink to the `homepage-ng` repository, see the existing
ones as a reference.

After some time (a maximum of 30 minutes) it should appear at
`http://git.frugalware.org/`.

== Enabling hooks for your repository

Currently you need hooks for the following reasons:
. If you don't use 'bare' repositories, then the content outside `.git` won't
be updated automatically, you need a hook to do so.

. If you want CIA notification.

. If you want sending mails to the `Frugalware-git` mailing list.

. If you want to let other be able to clone your repository via 'dumb'
protocols like `http` or `rsync`. (This means that if you disable this hook, it
won't be accessible anonymously!)

For the last one:

----
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-update
----

For the others:

----
ln -s /home/ftp/pub/other/git-hooks/git-hooks.py .git/hooks/post-receive
----
