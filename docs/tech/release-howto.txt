Introduction
------------

The aim of this howto is to show what's the procedure of a stable Frugalware
release. The to-be-created release in this howto is 0.4, the previous release
is 0.3.

Preparing
---------

- send a mail to -devel about "please stop version and release bumps"
- generate a new documentation with

	cd $fst/docs/texi/en_US
	make install clean

- sync the archs, checkpkgs shouldn't have any red pkg in it's output
- run gensync to rebuild the fdbs
- generate isos and test if everything is ok
  (ie. install from cd1-cd2 on i686, and start kde, or something)
- tag the release using darcs tag

Creating the stable tree
------------------------

Copy the full tree on genesis:

	cd /home/ftp/pub/frugalware
	cp -av frugalware-current frugalware-0.4

Updating the -current tree
--------------------------

Now one have two tree. All what one should do in -current is to bump
--from-tag version to 0.4 in tools/genpkgs

Updating the -stable tree
-------------------------

- rename the frugalware-current and extra-current fdbs to frugalware and extra
- rebuild the initrd with

	STABLE = true

  in the Makefile
- update $fst/boot/grub/menu.lst
- s/-current// in tools/{genpkgdbs,mkpkglst}
- remove the archs marked "development-only" from archs() in tools/genpkgdbs
- run the just modified genpkgs to regenerate the ChangeLog.txt to start from
  the 0.3 tag to the 0.4 tag
- update $tree and $isotree (see the comments) in tools/mkiso
- update pacman so that -stable will be the default on -Syu, not -current
- upload the fdbs to the mysql db using fdb2db, for example you can use the
  following script:

	for i in i686 x86_64
	do
		cd /home/ftp/pub/frugalware/frugalware-0.4/frugalware-$i/
		../tools/fdb2db -v -b ../source/ -r frugalware -e 0.4 \
			-f frugalware.fdb -a $i <params>
		cd ../extra/frugalware-$i/
		../../tools/fdb2db -v -b ../source/ -r extra -e 0.4 \
			-f extra.fdb -a $i <params>
	done

where <params> are the db host, user, pass, etc (of course not listed here)

Testing
-------

- generate isos, test _all_ of them (net,cd,dvd for each arch)
- check if the upgrade from 0.3->0.4 works or not, probably a simple -Syu is
  not enough, then write a howto

Announcement
------------

- put the isos online and wait at least 24h so that the mirrors will be in
  sync at release time
- ask Mark (mcangeli at gmail.com) via mail to upload the torrents for the
  isos to linuxtracker.org
- add the new version to the bts
- write an announcement, put it out to somewhere and ask Alex or LGee to
  spellcheck it
- add the new version to the releases table of the frugalware mysql db on
  genesis
- push it to the news page
- send it to -announce
- mark the release as "done" on the news page
- update the topic of #frugalware
- update the freshmeat entry

For the next release
--------------------

- find a codename
- update roadmap.php

Done!
