= Frugalware Source Tree Testsuite

== Introduction

The testsuite is a set of several simple unit tests. Most of the tests were
written when a typo was been found, so that we hope next time it'll be detected
automatically. When a problem was found, a test was created and the test
failed. After the problem was fixed the test passed. The statistics section
contains special tests: we are aware that they do not pass, but their actual
output is interesting for us. The output of the testsuite is sent to the
`frugalware-devel@` mailing list daily.

Since the tests in the testsuite section should pass, if one fails it is
expected to be fixed within a day, especially if your name is listed next to a
line.

You can find the tests under the `/t` directory of FST, the statistics are
under `/t/s`.

== Rules

Basically there are 3 simple rules for these tests:

- If the first argument is `--help`, they should print a short (less than 80
  chars) description. This will be displayed if the test fails as sometimes the
name of the test may not be descriptive enough.

- The tests are called in a `./testname` form, without any argument. This
  allows you to use various interpreted programming languages (python, bash,
etc.).

- If the test 'passes', there should be no output. This means that there may be
  a `-v` or `--verbose` option to generate output even if the test passes,
that's not a problem. If the test 'fails' there must be some output. For
example if there are problematic packages, then it's recommended to list each
package in a separate line with their path under FST.

== Technical details

Given that all the files in the fdb and fpm files are owned by root, if
you want to operate on them, then you need to use fakeroot. The
testsuite wrapper won't do this for you. A common practice is to write a
generic python script that operates on the fdb, then create a shell
wrapper for each arch, which will call the python script via fakeroot.
