= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.9 to 2.0

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.9
(Arcturus) system to Frugalware-2.0 (Rigel).

== Deprecated package removal

Some packages will not gracefully be removed because of strict dependencies.
If you encounter a message such as this during a system upgrade:
----
:: foobar-subpkg: requires foobar=1.0.0
----
Then you will need to perform this command for each of the removed packages:
----
pacman-g2 -Rd <PACKAGES>
----
<PACKAGES> must be replaced by the names of each of the removed packages.
This must be done prior to the system upgrade.

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved `pacman-g2`, you should install it
first:

----
pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== bind update

The caching example configuration we provide in the `bind` package is updated,
and `named.ca` is renamed to `named.root`. If you build your real configuration
on top of this example, make sure you update your `named.conf`.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
