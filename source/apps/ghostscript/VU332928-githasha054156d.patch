Bug 699658: Fix handling of pre-SAFER opened files.

Temp files opened for writing before SAFER is engaged are not subject to the
SAFER restrictions - that is handled by recording in a dictionary, and
checking that as part of the permissions checks.

By adding a custom error handler for invalidaccess, that allowed the filename
to be added to the dictionary (despite the attempted open throwing the error)
thus meaning subsequent accesses were erroneously permitted.
