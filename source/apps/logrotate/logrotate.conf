# /etc/logrotate.conf
#
# logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large
# numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression, removal, and
# mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or
# when it grows too large.
#
# logrotate is normally run daily from root's crontab.
#
# For more details, see "man logrotate".

# rotate log files weekly:
weekly

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs:
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones:
create

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed:
#compress

# some packages install log rotation information in this directory:
include /etc/logrotate.d

# Rotate /var/log/wtmp:
/var/log/wtmp {
    monthly
    create 0664 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

#/var/log/httpd/*.log {
#	monthly
#	missingok
#	rotate 3
#	compress
#	delaycompress
#	postrotate
#	if [ -f /var/run/httpd.pid ]; then
#		/etc/rc.d/rc.httpd restart > /dev/null
#	fi
#	endscript
#}

# Note that /var/log/lastlog is not rotated.  This is intentional, and it should
# not be.  The lastlog file is a database, and is also a sparse file that takes
# up much less space on the drive than it appears.
