Subject: libelf: Fix dir traversal vuln in ar extraction.

read_long_names terminates names at the first '/' found but then skips
one character without checking (it's supposed to be '\n'). Hence the
next name could start with any character including '/'. This leads to
a directory traversal vulnerability at the time the contents of the
archive is extracted.

The danger is mitigated by the fact that only one '/' is possible in a
resulting filename and only in the leading position. Hence only files
in the root directory can be written via this vuln and only when ar is
executed as root.

The fix for the vuln is to not skip any characters while looking
for '/'.
