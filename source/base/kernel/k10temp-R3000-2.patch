Subject: hwmon: (k10temp) Add support for AMD family 17h, model 70h CPUs

It would seem like model 70h is behaving in the same way as model 30h,
so let's just add the new F3 PCI ID to the list of compatible devices.

Unlike previous Ryzen/Threadripper, Ryzen gen 3 processors do not need
temperature offsets anymore. This has been reported in the press and
verified on my Ryzen 3700X by checking that the idle temperature
reported by k10temp is matching the temperature reported by the
firmware.

Vicki Pfau sent an identical patch after I checked that no-one had
written this patch. I would have been happy about dropping my patch but
unlike for his patch series, I had already Cc:ed the x86 people and
they already reviewed the changes. Since Vicki has not answered to
any email after his initial series, let's assume she is on vacation
and let's avoid duplication of reviews from the maintainers and merge
my series. To acknowledge Vicki's anteriority, I added her S-o-b to
the patch.

v2, suggested by Guenter Roeck and Brian Woods:
  - rename from 71h to 70h
