# Program: /usr/sbin/adduser
# Purpose: Interactive front end to /usr/sbin/useradd for FrugalWare Linux
# Author : Stuart Winter <stuart@polplex.co.uk>
#          Based on the original Slackware adduser by Hrvoje Dogan
#          with modifications by Patrick Volkerding and Miklós Vajna
#          with modifications by Wael Nasreddine <wael@nasreddine.com>
# Version: 1.10

# Usage..: adduser [<new_user_name>]

# History #
###########
# v1.10 - 2007-01-23                                                                                                      
#       * When choosing a non-existing initial group, ask about creating it. 
# v1.09 - 2005-09-30
#       * Adding defaults for additional groups
#       * Adding /etc/adduser.conf to edit the default without making changes
#         in this script
# v1.08 - 2004-04-28
#       * Imported to FrugalWare Linux
# v1.07 - 07/03/03
#       * When supplying a null string for the uid (meaning 'Choose next available'), 
#         if there were file names in the range 'a-z' in the pwd then the 
#         egrep command considered these files rather than the null string. 
#         The egrep expression is now in quotes.  
#         Reported & fixed by Vadim O. Ustiansky <sw>
# v1.06 - 31/03/03
#       * Ask to chown user.group the home directory if it already exists.
#         This helps reduce later confusion when adding users whose home dir
#         already exists (mounted partition for example) and is owned
#         by a user other than the user to which the directory is being
#         assigned as home.  Default is not to chown.
#         Brought to my attention by mRgOBLIN. <sw>
# v1.05 - 04/01/03
#       * Advise & prevent users from creating logins with '.' characters
#         in the user name. <sw>
#       * Made pending account creation info look neater <sw>
# v1.04 - 09/06/02
#       * Catered for shadow-4.0.3's 'useradd' binary that no longer
#         will let you create a user that has any uppercase chars in it
#         This was reported on the userlocal.org forums
#         by 'xcp' - thanks. <sw,pjv>
# v1.03 - 20/05/02
#       * Support 'broken' (null lines in) /etc/passwd and 
#         /etc/group files <sw>       
#       * For recycling UIDs (default still 'off'), we now look in 
#         /etc/login.defs for the UID_MIN value and use it
#         If not found then default to 1000 <sw>
# v1.02 - 10/04/02
#       * Fix user-specified UID bug. <pjv>
# v1.01 - 23/03/02
#       * Match Slackware indenting style, simplify. <pjv>
# v1.00 - 22/03/02
#       * Created
