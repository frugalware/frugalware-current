Narrator: Sugar .. Spice .. and everything Nice
          These are the ingredients to the perfect little girl.
          But Professor Utonium accidentally added one ingredient to the 
	  concoction: Chemical X
          Thus, the Powerpuff Girls were born. Using their ultra superpowers, 
	  Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup have dedicated their lives to 
	  fighting crime and the forces of evil!

Narrator: The city of Townsville!
%
Mayor: What a wonderful day for a celebration ... Girls, have I ever told you 
       the story of this old theatre?
Ms. Bellum: Just say yes.
Girls: No.
Mayor: Well, splendid. This theatre is the most historic site in all of 
       Townsville. Why, I used to see shows here when I was your age.
%
Mayor: I raised my hand, but he chose another. He chose a little girl.
%
Mayor: Poor old Al Lusion. Poor old theatre ... Oh, well, let the festivities 
       begin!
%
Mayor: Yes! Yes! Smash it! Smash it! Boom! Boom! Pow! Pow! Smash it, smash it, 
       smash it!
%
Blossom: What was that?
Bubbles: I think it.it was a zombie!
Buttercup: Cut it out, Bubbles. There.s no such thing as zombies.

...

Woman: A zombie!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! It's Al Lusion! He's returned from beyond the grave as 
          Abracadaver, the magical zombie!
%
Abracadaver: You laughed at me ... but now, revenge!
%
Mayor: Hmm. That's peculiar. Uh, Ms. Bellum, do you see this saw I see?
Ms. Bellum: Yes, but can't you see that all of Townsville is under attack?
Mayor: I think my hat's under attack! Call the haberdasher!
Ms. Bellum: Ahem!
Mayor: Oh, and the Powerpuff Girls.
%
Blossom: H-H-Hello?
%
Mayor: Blossom! You girls have to help at once!
Blossom: W-W-W-Why? What is it, Mayor?
Mayor: My favorite hat's been ruined, and, uh ... oh, yeah, Townsville's 
       under attack by an evil demented zombie magician.
Blossom: WHAT?! An evil demented zombie? 
Buttercup: No way! I'm not going!
Bubbles: Me neither. 
Blossom: I know it's scary, but.we have to.
%
Blossom: Oh ... um ... excuse me, Mr. Zombie, sir.
Abracadaver: Wha.?
Blossom: Could you stop destroying Townsville with your evil zombie magic?
Bubbles, Buttercup: Please?
%
Abracadaver: You! You're that girl! Girl with bear!
%
Blossom: Huh?
%
Buttercup: You put her down!
%
Buttercup: Uh-oh!
Abracadaver: You hit me!
%
Abracadaver: And now, my assistant ... time for grand finale!
%
Abracadaver: Now you meet your doom!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! Right before our very eyes ... the magic of the Powerpuff 
          Girls vanished forever! Now Townsville is at the mercy of that evil 
	  magician Abraca-huh!
%
Blossom: Ta-da!
Narrator: Blossom?!
Crowd: Yaaay!
%
Girls: Ta-da!
Crowd: Yaaay!
Mayor: But, girls! How did you do it?
Girls: It's magic, silly!
%
Narrator: How? ... Who? ... When? ... But? ... Who's in the? ...
%
Narrator: Oh, girls! I love that voodoo that you do!
%
Narrator: So once again the day is saved ... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville ... And like most cities, Townsville prepares 
          its young for bed as evening approaches.
%
Buttercup: Man, I'm not ready for bed yet!
Blossom: Now, girls, you know we need to get plenty of sleep. It's our 
         responsibility as superheroines to be well-rested, so that we'll be 
	 at peak crime-fighting performance whenever evil rears its ugly head.
%
Blossom: And, like Ben Franklin always said ... Early to bed, early to wake, 
         makes a lady smart, pretty, and great.
%
Buttercup: Yeah, yeah ... but all the fun stuff happens at night. Parties, 
           dancing, nightclubs and stuff. Girl, it'll be awesome once we're 
	   old enough to go out after dark. Right, Bubbles?
Bubbles: Uh ... no.
Buttercup: What do you mean, no?
Bubbles: I don't know.
Buttercup: You're not afraid of the dark, are you?
Bubbles: No.
Buttercup: You ain't scared of monsters under the bed, are you?
Bubbles: No.
Buttercup: Well, then. I guess you wouldn't be afraid of the Boogie Man, 
           either.
Blossom, Bubbles: Who?
%
Buttercup: Boogie Man! The creepiest, scariest, nastiest, 
           long-finger-and-pointy-teeth-havingest, little-kid-gettingest 
	   monster in the WORLD! But don't worry. He only comes out ...
	   after dark!
%
Professor: Wha?
%
Blossom, Bubbles: IT'S THE BOOGIE MAN!
Professor: What? Boogie Man? What's going on in here?
%
Professor: Buttercup ... are you teasing your sisters again?
%
Professor: Okay, Bubbles, calm down. Everything's all right now.
%
Professor: Yes, Blossom, I know. Buttercup likes to be an instigator.
%
Buttercup: Well, it's not my fault she's a baby scared of the dark.
%
Professor: Now, girls, being scared doesn't make you a baby. I was scared 
           when I heard my girls screaming. But did I hide under the covers?
%
Professor: Thank you, Blossom. You see, bravery doesn't mean you're not 
           scared. Bravery is doing what you're afraid to do. If you can 
	   just face your fears, then I know you can find the courage to 
	   beat 'em.
%
Professor: Now, then, everyone, into bed. It's time for sleeping.
%
Professor: And no more monkey business!
%
Narrator: Some kind of crazy beat?
%
Jerome: Listen up, all you freaks and disasters, and chill the frag out! 
        'Cause here comes the master! So give it up for the beast with the 
	plan! The one, the only, B-B-B-Boogie Man!
%
Boogie Man: Creatures of darkness ... DIG IT! Too long have we been at the 
            mercy of light. Nightlights, streetlights, hall lights with the 
	    door cracked. And deeper still ... the sun. I know, I know. But I, 
	    your Boogie Man, have just completed Step One of my grand master 
	    plan that will ensure an end to this problem once and for all. 
	    So prepare to hit the streets ... cause we are gonna party ALL
	    NIGHT LONG!
%
Boogie Man: So tell me. When things get creepy.
Crowd: Blame it on the boogie!
Boogie Man: When things get spooky.
Crowd: Blame it on the boogie!
Boogie Man: And when things get freaky, funky, and nasty.
Crowd: BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE!!
%
Narrator: Uh-oh! What's he got cooking at the Townsville Power Plant?
%
Narrator: Oh, my gosh. They've cut off all power to Townsville! That means ...
          no more streetlights ... no more hall lights with the door 
	  cracked ... and definitely no more nightlights!
%
Monster under bed: Hehehe The coast is clear! Come on!
%
Slug: Fashionably late again, I see. So fashionable you missed the party.
%
Slug: Peep it! The sun's already risin'. We're gonna have to blow this joint.
%
Bartender: LAST CALL!! 
Jerome: Let's wrap it up, people! The sun's comin' up!
Boogie Man: Hold up, hold up! Did you all forget about my grand master plan? 
            The sun will no longer be an issue once I initiate the third and 
	    final step.
Slug: Is Step Three really all that?
Boogie Man: Shoot. It ain't no step for a stepper.
%
Narrator: It's a giant disco ball!
Narrator: And it's eclipsing the sun! Oh, no! Now morning will never come to 
          Townsville!
%
Narrator: And these nocturnal nightmares will be free to haunt the darkness 
          forever!
Crowd: BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE!!
%
Blossom: I CAN'T GET ANY SLEEP!! With all that racket out there! Something 
         funky.s going on downtown.
Buttercup: I'll say! We better check it out!
Blossom: Yeah. It might be trouble!
%
Blossom: Oh, my gosh! Townsville's been turned into a nightmare nightclub!
Buttercup: Right on! Right, Bubbles?
Bubbles: Well, it's got a good beat, and I can dance to it. 
%
Cat: Yeah, little girl, I thought you liked to party.
%
Buttercup: Let's get down!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! The girls are getting swamped!
%
Blossom: I can see a small exhaust port at the end of the chasm. If we could 
         just hit it with our laser vision, it should destroy the ball!
%
Narrator: Oh, yes! The sun is free to shine on Townsville again! Sorry, 
          nightmares. Party's over. And don't let the doorknob hit ya where 
	  the dog shoulda bit ya.
%
Bubbles: Okay! I'm ready!
Professor: Awww, ain't she cute?
%
Professor: You see, Bubbles, you're not ready for the higher levels yet. 
           Oh, don't worry, cheer up. Someday you will be.
Bubbles: It's not fair.
Professor: She's so cute when she's all pouty like that.
%
Bubbles: It's not fair! I'm just as tough and strong and mean as Buttercup 
         and Blossom, but they just don't believe me. They all treat me like 
	 a baby. I'll show them. I'll prove that I can be ... hard-core!
%
Bubbles: Mission begin!
%
Bubbles: WHO ELSE WANTS SOME?!?
%
Blossom: What's the matter? Am I too fast for cute little Bubbles?
%
Bubbles: Ha! I got you! You're out! Gone! Finished! You were beaten down, 
         sister, by CUTE! LITTLE! BUBBLES!!
%
Talking Dog: Oh, hi, Bubbles. How are youuuuu.
Bubbles: Bad dog! Bad dog! BAD DOG!
%
Talking Dog: No, Bubbles! Have mercy!
Bubbles: Mercy is for the weak!
%
Blossom: Bubbles!
Buttercup: Have you lost your mind?
Blossom: This isn't the Bubbles we know!
Bubbles: The Bubbles you know is gone! I'm hard-core now!
%
Bubbles: I don't mean to burst your bubble, girls, but from now on ... I 
         fly solo!
%
Narrator: Whoa! Sister's doin' it for herself! Let's hope she knows what 
          she's doing.
%
Mojo: Now that I have you, my sweet little Bubbles ... nothing can stop my 
      plan to take over the world!
Bubbles: What plan?!
Mojo: I'll tell you! I plan to zap you with my laser, causing you to cry 
      out ... just wike a wittle baby ... which in turn will cause your 
      sisters to come flying to your rescue, for which I am well prepared, 
      as you can see.
%
Bubbles: That's the dumbest plan I've ever heard! AND I'M NOT A BABY!
%
Mojo: Well, we'll see about that!
%
Bubbles: I'm not.gonna..cry ... you.. dumb.. doo-doo-brain!
Mojo: Doo-doo-brain? That's it! I've had it with your sassy mouth! I didn't 
      want to do this!
%
Mojo: Yes! Yes! That's it!
%
Blossom: Wow, Bubbles! I can't believe you defeated Mojo all by yourself! 
         You really whooped him!
%
Blossom, Buttercup: You're hard-core!
%
Bubbles: Why, you! How dare you zap me and my sisters? Take this! And that! 
         And this! And this! And that!
%
Narrator: Oh, Bubbles, you're so cute when you're all tough like that! So 
          once again the day is saved ... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville. A pleasant place to live. Unless you run 
          into ... the Gangrene Gang! The biggest bunch of belligerent bullies 
	  this town's ever seen!
%
Ace: Mister? You're talkin' to Ace, kid. There are no Misters here ... at 
     least, I don't think so. Um, Little Arturo, is your name Mister?
%
Grubber: Pbbbbpppppbbbbbt!
%
Ace: Yeah, I thought so. Hey, is your name Mister, Snake?
%
Blossom: Let the underwear go!
%
Arturo: The Powerpuff Girls?
Billy: The Powerpuff Girls?
Snake: The P-P-Powerpuff Girls-s-s?
Grubber: Pbbbbpppbbbt?
Ace: The Powerpuff Girls?
%
Ace: Oh, Powerpuff Girls ... please forgive my foolish friend for his foolish 
     act. For he did not know what he was doin'.  And I know deep inside my 
     heart that he would never do anything like that ever again. What do you 
     say, girls? Will you forgive him? Will you? Please?
%
Narrator: Oh, no! Looks like Buttercup is looking for love in all the wrong 
          places.
%
Narrator: Next day. Townsville Museum of Natural History.
%
Narrator: Oh, look! The Pokey Oak Kindergarten class is on a field trip. 
          And so is ... the Gangrene Gang?! This can't be good.
%
Billy: Big Billy no get soda.
Snake: I think she needs moneys-s-s.
Arturo: This Mesopotamian vase is probably worth a couple of bucks.
%
Ace: Slip it in right here, Arturo.
%
Ace: Now this has gotta be worth at least one soda.
Blossom: Drop that mummy!
Ace, Snake, Arturo, Billy: The Powerpuff Girls!
%
Blossom: All right, girls. Let's show these creeps how to respect other 
         people's property!
%
Ace: Hey. Buttercup, how come you guys always pick on us, huh?
%
Ace: W-We was only tryin' to get a soda.
%
Ace: You know, kid? You're not so bad. You can hang out with us anytime.
%
Narrator: That evening ... Oh, no! ... She isn't! ... She is.
%
Narrator: I hope she knows what she's doing.
%
Snake: W-W-W-What-What she's doing here-s-s, Boss-s-s?
Ace: Back up! Relax!
%
Ace: Buttercup. Please, come in.
%
Ace: Oh, Buttercup! Last night was a hoot! So will you please be my guest 
     again tonight?
%
Ace: Don't you realize that with Buttercup on our side ... 
     WE COULD CONTROL TOWNSVILLE?!
%
Ace: Sit for a spell, fellas, 'cause I've got a plan.
%
Narrator: Well, that sounds awful! Evil people with evil plans? I hope the 
          Powerpuff Girls can get out of this one ... especially Buttercup!
%
Ace: Showtime!
%
Snake: Huh? Oh, right. See you two a little bit laters-s-s.
Ace: They'll be back. With pizza!
%
Snake: Come on, s-s-stop laughing! Do it rights-s-s!
%
Grubber: Oh, hello. I'm Buttercup, and my foot got caught in a conveyor belt 
         at the city dump. I'm afraid I'm stuck. Help me!
Bubbles: Okay. Bye-bye. BUTTERCUP'S IN TROUBLE!!
%
Snake: S-S-Say goodbye, Powerpuffs-s-s!
%
Narrator: This is unbelievable! Is this the end of our beloved girls?
%
Narrator: Can no one save our heroes from this impending doom? Can Buttercup 
          not hear her sisters' cries for help?
%
Narrator: Oh, no! Blossom and Bubbles' screams are being drowned out by this 
          rogue Romeo's rambunctious rock!
%
Snake: Adios-s-s, dos amigos-s-s!
%
Ace: Buttercup, I'm innocent! The boys, they put me up to it! Honest!
%
Narrator: Aww, we forgive you, Buttercup.
%
Narrator: And so once again the day is saved ... thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville. A place where catastrophe can strike at 
          any minute.
%
Bubbles: You're the most cutest kitty in the whole world. Yes, you are. And 
         to think that mean old man had you all to himself. Do you think 
	 we'll be able to keep him?
%
Buttercup: We're not keeping that stinky fleabag. Because I'm gonna end up 
           feeding it, and cleaning it, and loving it.
%
Girls: Awwww
%
Bubbles: No, you didn't. We're just getting ready for bed. And everything is 
         as normal as normal could beEEEEE!
%
Blossom: Well, there was this bad man, and he had this raygun.
Buttercup: And then we were punching and kicking, and then the cops came.
Bubbles: And then the place started to fall apart!
%
Professor: But Kitty can stay tonight. I have a lot of work to do in the lab, 
           so I'll decide tomorrow. Now get those sleepy heads into bed.
%
Professor: Good night, little angels.
%
Blossom: The cat's in the bag once the Professor sees his breakfast!
%
Professor: No! None of you can ever hold Kitty!
%
Professor: Girls! I know I haven't told you, but the laboratory is now off 
           limits. Bye.
%
Professor: Yes, Master.
%
Kitty: Purrrrrrfect.
%
Blossom: Bubbles, you get it. I'm too tired.
Bubbles: Powerpuff hotline.
Bubbles: We're on our way, Mayor! WAKE UP!!
%
Bubbles: Wait! What if the cat is really the bad guy, and he put the Professor 
         under a hypnotic trance and made the Professor build this evil 
	 machine, and then they stole the jewel to power the machine, and then 
	 they're gonna use it to hypnotize all the people so that the cats can 
	 rise up and take over Townsville?!
Buttercup: Bubbles, if we didn't have to sit through your ridiculous 
           ramblings, we.d be halfway to solving this crime!
%
Narrator: Oh, Bubbles ... you don't know how right you are! For at this very 
          moment, a catastrophe is about to befall ... the city of Townsville!
%
Kitty: And now for the final step. Professor?
%
Kitty: Activate the beam!
Professor: Yes, Master.
%
Professor: Girls! Oh'oh, I just had the craziest dream! I dreamt I was 
           hypnotized by a cat, we stole a jewel, and I jumped off a building!
	   Pretty crazy, huh?
%
Narrator: Oh, be quiet! Bad kitty! If you think the girls are gonna help you, 
          you're barking up the wrong .. I mean, you're meowing up the .. 
	  the .. oh, well.
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville! ... A community where random acts of kindness
          are an everyday occurrence.
%
Fuzzy: Hey, you! Get offa my property! Now!
%
Narrator: Some people like ... Fuzzy Lumkins!
%
Fuzzy: Get offa my property!
%
Fuzzy: Hey! Get off my property right now!
%
Fuzzy: Consarn it! Anyone else wanna try and get on my property?!
%
Fuzzy: Jo? Jo? Where you at, Jo? Where is you? Jo! Joey! J-oh.
%
Fuzzy: Now you stay right 'cheer, Jo .. where you gonna be safe .. from all 
       y'all who wants to get your mitts on my property!
%
Narrator: Oh, no! He's heading towards Townsville!
%
Fuzzy: Where you at, you crazy critter?
%
Old woman: Excuse me, sonny, but I believe you dropped your hat.
%
Fuzzy: GET YOUR WRINKLES OFFA MY PROPERTY!!
%
Fuzzy: Stop it, stop it, STOP IT! Stop touchin' my property!
%
Policeman: So, you like punchin' out old ladies, huh? Well .. I have one 
           question for you... Is this your hat?
%
Fuzzy: Y'ALL GET YOUR MITTS OFFA MY PROPERTY!!
%
Blossom: Who are you to come mess up our town?
%
Fuzzy: GET .. OFFA .. MY .. PROPERTY!!
%
Fuzzy: OH, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
%
Fuzzy: Huh?
%
Narrator: Townsville Prison!
%
Narrator: How do you like that, Mr. No-Share?
%
Narrator: So once again the day is saved .. thanks to the Powerpuff Girls! I 
          get a warm, fuzzy feeling just saying that.
%
Narrator: The city of Townsville .. A place filled with some of the most 
          brilliant, clever, and ingenious criminal masterminds ever to hatch 
	  an evil scheme.
%
Narrator: Then there's the Amoeba Boys.
%
Bossman: We did it! We're official criminals!
Tiny: Yeah, criminals!
Skinny: Yeah!
%
Bossman: You didn't take it, did you?
Tiny: He didn't take it, Boss!
Skinny: I was going to, but .. that would be stealing.
%
Bossman: That's it! I spend months planning that orange heist, and you go 
         and choke at the last minute. Don't you have any backbone, you.
%
Blossom: Sorry, guys. You're gonna have to do better than that. Come on, 
         girls. Let's go.
%
Bossman: No! Wait! So you wanna see a crime, huh?
%
Narrator: Townsville Park .. A clean place for clean folks to have good clean 
          fun.
%
Mayor: Hello? He .. What? .. You can't come in? .. You're sick? What? Hello? 
       You're sick too, you can't come in. Hello? Hello .. You're sick? Sick! 
       Sick! Everyone's sick! Oh! Ms. Bellum. Thank goodness you're here.
%
Blossom: I'll get it! Yes, Mayor? What's the trouble? Huh? You're sick? .. 
         Well, that's too bad, Mr. Mayor, but it doesn't sound like an 
	 emergency. Now, tell everyone to get lots of rest and drink plenty of 
	 liquids. And only call when there's a real emergency. Remember .. 
	 the hotline is not a toy.
%
Kids: ICE CREAM!!
%
Girls: Ewwwwww!
%
Buttercup: Uh-oh. Look!
%
Bubbles: Sorry, guys. I gotta go save people and stuff.
%
Bossman: Hey, Buttercup.
Buttercup: Buzz off, guys!
%
Bossman: Okay, we got a crime. Watch!
Blossom: Cut it out, guys! Not now!
%
Buttercup: You three are the lousiest, most pathetic criminals ever to walk 
           the street! You stink! We don't ever want to see you again! Get 
	   out of town! Don't ever come back! Get out! Get out! GET OUT!!
%
Professor: Sick. I know. I'm already working on it. I've managed to isolate 
           the virus, but it doesn't conform to any virus ever documented. I 
	   believe it's a new strain. Have a look.
%
Blossom: Professor .. those look just like the Amoeba Boys.
%
Professor: The Amoeba Boys? Hmm. I wonder if .. now this is only a hunch, but 
           suppose the Amoeba Boys were standing in the park next to a "Keep 
	   Off the Grass" *cough* sign, in an attempt to break the law .. when 
	   a storm rolled in. Now suppose they stood in the rain all night and 
	   caught a *cough* cold. That cold could mix with their single-cell 
	   anatomy to create a devastating new virus .. that could then infect 
	   all of Townsville.
%
Professor: Of course, that's only a hunch. Girls! You must find the Amoeba 
           Boys. The antidote is within them! Do you know where they are?
%
Narrator: And so the Powerpuff Girls began to search for the hosts *cough* of 
          one of the most deadly viruses ever to befall mankind.
%
Blossom: Uh..? The Amoeba Boys?  Oh .. you gotta come back with us right away.
Bossman: But I thought we were lousy criminals and you never wanted to see 
         us again.
Blossom: No! That's not true! You three could be the worst criminals in the 
         history of Townsville.
%
Bossman: Wait a minute! Why should I, copper? You're not taking us without a 
         fight!
Tiny: Yeah! Without a fight!
%
Professor: Okay, Amoeba Boys. Thank you for your cooperation. You're free to go.
Bossman: Go?! I thought we were criminals! You locked us up and everything!
Professor: Well, everything's all right now. Out you go.
%
Professor: Bye now.
Bossman: I told you, you shoulda taken the orange!
%
Professor: Force equals the cosine of the direct.no, that's not it! .. Darn it!
%
Blossom: This oatmeal's too hot!
Bubbles: Too hot!
Buttercup: So blow on it!
%
Narrator: And wouldn't you know, of all days, today would be the day Blossom 
          discovers she has a new power.
%
Narrator: Ice breath!
%
Blossom: Hey guys, look what I just did!
Buttercup: Hmmm .. do it again.
%
Bubbles: I know, I know! Make the floor all ice, like in Tom and Jerry. 
         That's my favorite.
%
Buttercup: Yeah! Make the floor all ice, Blossom!
Blossom: Well, I'll try.
%
Professor: ButterCUUUUUP!
%
Professor: How on earth did you do it?
Bubbles: She blowed, and ice came out!
Buttercup: She's got ice breath, Professor!
Professor: You're kidding! Show me, Blossom.
%
Professor: Incredible!
%
Professor: Well, Buttercup .. you know, even though you all have super 
           abilities like super strength and being able to fly and laser eye 
	   beams, you also each have your own special unique abilities, like 
	   Bubbles being able to speak Spanish.
Bubbles: Sí!
%
Ms. Keane: Of all the days for the air conditioner to break!
%
Ms. Keane: Teddy, I don't care. Now go play!
%
Narrator: Outside? In this heat wave? Oh, the poor little things.
%
Repairman: Sorry, Ms. Keane. I'll have to come back tomorrow.
Ms. Keane: Great. Just great! Stupid heat! It's like walking into an oven!
%
Bubbles: Ms. Keane! Ms. Keane! Blossom's doing something bad.
Ms. Keane: What are you talking about? Blossom never does anything bad.
%
Ms. Keane: It's wonderful!
Blossom: Thanks.
Ms. Keane: Blossom, what a nice thing you're doing.
%
Buttercup: That stupid goody-goody Blossom never gets in trouble!
%
Buttercup: Hello? .. A robbery? .. We'll be right there!
%
Buttercup: Hey, ice princess! We got work!
Blossom: Oh, okay. I just gotta finish making snow cones for everybody.
