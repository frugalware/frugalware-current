Subject: [PATCH] src/libFLAC/stream_decoder.c : Fail safely to avoid a heap overflow.

This fix is closely related to the fix for CVE-2014-9028. When that
fix went public Miroslav Lichvar noticed a similar potential problem
spot in the same function and was able to craft a file to trigger a
heap write overflow.
