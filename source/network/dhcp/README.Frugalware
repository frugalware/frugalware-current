If you are in trouble setting up your dhclient, use the
following options. These are quite good defaults:

request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, \
	routers, domain-name, domain-name-servers, \
	host-name, netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope;
timeout 20;
script "/sbin/dhclient-script";
