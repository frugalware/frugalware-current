Subject: Don't break grab and focus state for a window when redirecting it.
X-Git-Url: http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/xserver.git;a=commitdiff;h=a6a7fadbb03ee99312dfb15ac478ab3c414c1c0b

Don't break grab and focus state for a window when redirecting it.

Composite uses an unmap/map cycle to trigger backing pixmap allocation
and cliprect recomputation when a window is redirected or unredirected.
To avoid protocol visible side effects, map and unmap events are
disabled temporarily.  However, when a window is unmapped it is also
removed from grabs and loses focus, but these state changes are not
disabled.

This change supresses the unmap side effects during the composite
unmap/map cycle and fixes this bug:

  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488264

where compiz would cause gnome-screensaver to lose its grab when
compiz unredirects the fullscreen lock window.
