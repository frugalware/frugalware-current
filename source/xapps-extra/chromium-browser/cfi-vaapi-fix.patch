Subject: [PATCH] Disable cfi-icall for media/gpu/vaapi/va_stubs.cc

Similarly to pulse_stubs.cc, va_stubs.cc contains dlsym() resolved
functions which trigger cfi-icall failures. The affected builds of
Chromium do use out-of-tree patches to enable hardware-accelerated
video decode on Linux where the VA-API driver is installed, but it
would still be nice to have them work with cfi-icall enabled.
