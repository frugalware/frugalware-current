# Config file for gpsd server

# ATTENTION: most of the configuration is done in the kernel device
# setup for USB/Serial, Garmin, or other.

# Set GPS_DEV to the device to be used by the gpsd server.
# This device must have the group tty and be writable (see
# the udev rule in the docs).

# This example is for a Deluo GPS Serial/USB converter dongle, really
# a pl2303 chip - CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_PL2303 in modern 2.6 kernels.
# The udev rule provides the symlink below to /dev/tts/USB0
# The second one is just a normal serial port...

#GPS_DEV="/dev/ttyUSB0"

#GPSD_OPTS="-n /dev/ttyUSB0"
